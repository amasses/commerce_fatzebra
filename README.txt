This module adds the Australian payment gateway Fat Zebra as a payment method
for Drupal Commerce.

This module is sponsored by Morgan (http://morgan.net.au) and Fat Zebra
(https://fatzebra.com.au).

INSTALLATION
------------

- Install the Commerce Fat Zebra module
- Enable Fat Zebra Integration under Store > Configuration > Payment methods
- Edit the Payment method's action to configure payment settings, and to set
username/token if you have a Fat Zebra account

TESTING
-------

Nothing further is required to fully test the module against the sandbox
environment (module defaults to test credentials), however you will not have
access to the Fat Zebra dashboard to see transaction summaries.

If you'd like to get a Fat Zebra account you can sign up
